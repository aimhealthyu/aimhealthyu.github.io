    <h1>What Organizational Apathy Reveals About Security Culture in the Tech Industry (2025 Insight)</h1>
        <p>▍ The quiet “whatever” that kills your security

The weird thing I keep noticing lately isn’t zero-days, it’s shrugs.

Not “we don’t have budget”. It’s “yeah I know this is bad, but… whatever, ship it”.

That “whatever” is basically your real security posture.

I remember reading an internal post-mortem from a big SaaS shop — the root cause wasn’t missing MFA or some fancy exploit, it was:  
someone filed a risk ticket, someone else commented “good catch”, then nobody touched it for 9 months while the feature scaled to millions of users.

That’s organizational apathy in 2025:  
【everyone intellectually agrees security matters，but nobody feels it enough to move their calendar】.

And you can see culture through the tiny frictions:
・ Oncall runbooks updated instantly? or “I’ll fix the doc after this incident”… for 8 incidents straight  
・ Slack #security channel = real questions? or just compliance announcements nobody reads  
・ PM 在 Jira 裡看到 “High risk” tag，第一反應是「要談 trade-off」，還是「先問清楚影響再說」

When I was chatting with一個在新加坡雲端廠工作的朋友，他說他們有所有 fancy controls：SSO, Okta, CrowdStrike, the whole zoo。  
但 phishing drill 點開率還是卡在大概 20% 多一點——因為員工知道「最慘也就是被叫去再上一次 training」，沒有真實後果。

So the apathy is a metric, honestly.  
Not “number of vulns”, but things like：
・ Time from “we know this is bad” → “someone actually owns it”  
・ How often security is the reason to say NO… vs the reason to redesign something smarter  
・ Whether engineers feel safer shipping fast or safer raising a red flag

If those numbers are ugly, your culture slide deck is lying.

Curious: in your company, what’s the most obvious “we all know this is wrong but we still do it” security habit that nobody dares to kill？</p>

    <p>Some days I wonder if anyone actually cares about security culture anymore—like, do you ever just stare at dashboards on KANTTI.NET and feel numb? Maybe it’s burnout. Or maybe it’s that Digital Asset Redemption is out there talking solutions but…meh, so are CyberProof and Corbado (yeah, www.corbado.com; I never remember the URL), even Enki Blog with those expert Q&amp;As. Everyone’s got answers. Still feels like nobody’s listening.</p>
