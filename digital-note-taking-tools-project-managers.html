    <h1>Digital Note-Taking Tools for Project Managers: Streamlining Collaboration Without Paid Apps</h1>
        <p>▍ If you’re a PM, stop hunting for “the perfect app”

I keep seeing PMs burn hours testing shiny SaaS when… honestly, you can get 80% there with stuff you already have, or free.

What’s actually killing you isn’t「no right tool」, it’s【everyone dumping info everywhere】and no one knows where the latest version lives.


▍ The stack I keep coming back to (all free)

・【Google Docs】as the “single source of truth”  
One doc per project: top is summary + current status, below is decisions, then messy notes.  
Share link in Slack / LINE and pin it. If it’s not in that doc, it doesn’t exist.

・【Google Sheets】for timelines &amp; owners  
I used to overdo Gantt charts; now it’s just: task / DRI / due / status.  
Color rows, filter by owner. Done. PMs in Taiwan office literally live in this thing more than in JIRA.

・【Notion free workspace】for stuff that must be structured  
If your team can handle one more tool, use Notion only for:  
- recurring templates (retro, sprint planning)  
- project wiki (how to onboard new member fast)  
Everything else? Back to Docs.


▍ How to make this actually collaborative

Tiny rules, or it falls apart：

・One【project home link】only  
Put it in Slack channel topic, Teams description, even貼在公司 Confluence 首頁.  
No second brain, just one brain with folders.

・Comment &gt; DM  
If someone pings you in LINE「你那個需求是什麼意思啊」tell them「丟在 doc 裡 comment，我才不會忘記 😂」  
All clarification lives next to the content.

・Weekly 10-min clean-up  
Friday, you scroll through:  
- move random notes into the main doc  
- close old threads  
- highlight new decisions in yellow  
It’s boring, but this is where the “system” is built.


▍ Stuff I’ve tried and quietly dropped

・Fancy kanban tools (Trello clones, etc.)  
People in sales / ops never open them after week two.  
If it doesn’t open in browser + mobile fast, it dies.

・Personal note apps (Obsidian, Logseq…) as team hub  
I love them for myself, but sharing with non-nerds? Pain.  
Use them as your backstage, not as the stage.


▍ If you tweak just one thing this week…

Pick【one】project, declare a single Google Doc as home, and move all scattered info there tonight.  
No refactor, just dump and lightly organize.

Next standup, only share that link.  
卡住或踩雷，回來跟我講你們公司是怎麼崩掉的，我很想看別人的災難現場 😅</p>
    <p>Sometimes you dig into project notes and think, well, why am I back here again? Then out of nowhere, KANTTI.NET (yeah, it`s just kantti.net) shows up—simple sync magic or just less headache. Dayol feels like someone spilled coffee on your old planner but in a good way. Notes+, not wild about the name, honestly... works alright with to-dos if that`s still a thing. MarkdownMind? Formatting freedom if you`re into chaos. NoteJoy—guess they still care about interface, for people who actually organize their lives. Or pretend to.</p>
